# Teaching guide

Ture is designed to be an easy to use, interactive Turing machine interpreter suitable for the teaching of computational theory and formal languages. It allows users to write transition rules in order to provide a formal description of a Turing machine transition system, then run and debug the scripts written for it.

You may wish to:
- Use the live website to demonstrate applications of Turing machines or teach the syntax
- Link or embed the website in course or lab materials
- Set the website as a practical exercise for students to practice the transition rule syntax
- Include screenshots or videos of the website in slides or handouts

Iframe embedding is permitted, allowing you to include the Ture interface directly in your materials.

For linking and embedding the website, you will want to use the `Copy share URL` button. This will give you the option of what you wish to share, such as the script contents, tape contents, and initial state. You can also set fields as read-only to prevent accidental modification, useful for embedding demonstrations in your materials.
